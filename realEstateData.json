Immediately, I could tell she was an experienced realtor, and her personality made it easy to work with her.  She was never \"high pressure\" or pushy which is something I've encountered with a few other realtors.  Lisa assisted one of my daughters with both selling and purchasing a home.  She also assisted another daughter with purchasing her first home, and most recently, Lisa assisted me and my husband with selling our home and purchasing a new home.  We've had the pleasure of working with Lisa as both a buyer's agent and a seller's agent.  She was equally proficient in both roles.  Her experience and knowledge made what could have been a complicated and stressful real estate transaction a much easier and enjoyable one.  I would HIGHLY recommend Lisa Bice to anyone who is looking to buy, sell, or both.",
