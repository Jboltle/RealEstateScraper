He personally was on site for every showing and provided follow up to make sure the prospective buyer had all the info they were seeking.

I will update this after my next purchase but I’m sure it will go just as smoothly as the rest.

I came upon a mailer from Fabio that I received back in the Fall of 2019. I called him in June and the moment I met him I knew I would be in good hands, I was right! While I never met you Simon, I dealt with Fabio and my experience was excellent. Fabio was so helpful in so many ways to make sure the condo was in the best shape it could be before listing it. He walked me through every process and he was so hands on to help fix or replace items that had to be done. I can't thank him enough for all of his help.My experience working with you both was excellent. I want to thank you both for all of your help and for handling the sale in such a professional manner.Thank you!!!",
